# Homework 4, Assignment 1

The review file has been submitted to the repository of Nick Jones and pull requested.

# Note! It has been submitted to his HW3 homework directory! It is now in his PUI2017 directory (don't know why he put it there). In my HW4 directory there is a copy of it.

# Homework 4, Assignment 2

I preferred to do this assignment individually. Below is the table.
