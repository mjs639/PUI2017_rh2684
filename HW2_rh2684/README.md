## <b>Homework 2</b>

<p>Assignments 1 and 2 are in this repository.

Assignment 3 in HW2_assignment3_rh2684.ipynb Jupiter Notebook. This assignment is done fetching the NYC Open Data datasets, since the DFDATA was not working. The environmental variable $DFDATA is all set up, though, and the script checks whether or not it exists.</ br>

The datasets are:

1. <a href = "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/rt5r-ie69.csv" target = "_blank"> Dataset 1: The SAT exams data </a>
2. <a href = "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/gqrb-77i6.csv" target = "_blank"> Dataset 2: Daily inmates in custody</a></p>
